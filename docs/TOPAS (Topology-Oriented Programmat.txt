TOPAS (Topology-Oriented Programmatic Abstraction System) is our ARC Prize‚Äìlevel contender. It‚Äôs a neurosymbolic + neuromorphic system designed to solve the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) tasks with 85%+ exact accuracy, blending symbolic DSL search with neural backbones and biologically inspired memory/plasticity. 

Mission: Build a solver that learns like a brain ‚Äî fast, general, adaptive ‚Äî while remaining fully differentiable for training. ARC is our proving ground, but the deeper goal is to create a research-grade, faithful neuromorphic reasoning engine.
