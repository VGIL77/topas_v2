# **TopasARCTrainer Integration and Training Guide**

## **Overview**
TopasARC is designed to create a **superhuman AGI** for solving **ARC tasks** with **unprecedented speed** and **accuracy**. It combines **meta-learning**, **self-critique**, **deep search** (via **MCTS**), and **neuro-priors** to train a model that can solve **complex ARC tasks**.

---

## **Key Features**:
1. **World Grammar Pretraining**:
   - Pretrain on **synthetic ARC tasks** to instill **latent grammar** (grid relations, symmetry, object counting).
2. **Meta-Learning (MAML/Reptile)**:
   - Enables **few-shot learning** for **new tasks** with minimal updates.
3. **Self-Critique**:
   - Learn from **failures** by generating **counterexamples** and refining the model through **trace bootstrapping**.
4. **MCTS for Solution Search**:
   - **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** is used for exploring **deeper solutions** (program length 6–10).
5. **SGI Optimization**:
   - Uses **Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)** for improved **generalization**.
6. **Truth-Conditioned Ensembling**:
   - **Self-consistency** and **mixture-of-experts** ensure that **the best solution** is always selected.

## **Training Phases**:

### **Phase 0: World Grammar Pretraining** (5 Epochs)
- **Goal**: Teach the model basic ARC grammar (sizes, symmetries, relations).
- **Training Data**: **Synthetic ARC tasks** (input → output pairs).
- **Loss Function**:
  \[
  L = \lambda_g \, 	ext{CE(grid)} + \lambda_p \, 	ext{CE(program_tokens)} + \lambda_s \, 	ext{CE(size_class)} + \lambda_{sym} \, 	ext{CE(symmetry)} + \lambda_h \, \ell_1(\Delta 	ext{histogram})
  \]
  - **CE**: Cross-entropy loss for grid predictions, program tokens, size classes, and symmetries.
  - **\(\ell_1\)**: L1 loss for **histogram differences**.

---

### **Phase 1: Search → Policy Distillation**
- **Goal**: Convert **beam search** and **EBR trajectories** into a **policy network**.
- **Teacher**: **Beam search** traces.
- **Student**: **OpPolicyNet** (program policy) trained with **teacher-forced learning**.
- **ValueNet**: **Prunes** beams and **ranks** candidates based on **solvability**.

---

### **Phase 2: Meta-Learning** (Few-Shot Task Adaptation)
- **Goal**: Enable the model to adapt to **new tasks** with **minimal updates**.
- **Method**: **MAML** or **Reptile** (meta-learning algorithms).
- **Objective**: Achieve **Exact@1** on **unseen examples** after 1-3 updates.

---

### **Phase 3: Self-Critique & STaR Bootstrapping**
- **Goal**: Teach the model to **learn from failures**.
- **Method**: **Counterexamples** are generated (swapping colors, mirroring, size changes, object permutations).
- **Trace Validation**: Ensure that **two different successful traces** produce the **same grid** and agree on **size/symmetry heads**.

---

### **Phase 4: Alpha-DSL + MCTS**
- **Goal**: **Explore deeper solutions** using **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**.
- **MCTS** explores programs with **length 6–10**.
- **Distillation**: **Distill MCTS** results into **OpPolicyNet** and **ValueNet**.

---

### **Phase 5: Per-Object Mastery**
- **Goal**: Make **per-object operations** first-class.
- **Method**: Use **Slot Attention** to extract **object-level features** (e.g., bbox, area, adjacency).
- **Predict Object Relations**: **Touching**, **Contained**, **Aligned**.

---

### **Phase 6: Neuro-Priors as Rewards**
- **Goal**: Use **neuro-priors** (Φ, κ, CGE) as **reward signals** during training.
- **Method**: Integrate **Φ**, **κ**, and **CGE** priors into the loss function.

---

### **Phase 7: Template Retrieval & Curriculum Shaping**
- **Goal**: **Retrieve templates** from **previous solutions** and dynamically adjust task difficulty.
- **Method**: Use **wormhole mining** for **template retrieval** and **curriculum shaping** to adjust task complexity.

---

### **Phase 8: SGI-Tuned Optimization**
- **Goal**: **Optimize** the model for **generalization** and **stability**.
- **Method**: **SAM Optimizer** and **SGI Optimizer** for **stable convergence**.
- **Optimizer**: **AdamW**, **cosine learning rate** schedule, **grad clipping**.

---

### **Phase 9: Truth-Conditioned Ensembling**
- **Goal**: Final **ensemble learning** to ensure **best solution**.
- **Method**: Use **self-consistency** (sampling 8–16 traces from **OpPolicyNet**) and **mixture-of-experts** (train 2–3 experts like **SymmetryNet** and **CountingNet**).

---

## **Math Behind the Model**

### **Loss Functions**:

1. **Program Loss**:
   \[
   L_{	ext{program}} = \lambda_g \, 	ext{CE(grid)} + \lambda_p \, 	ext{CE(program_tokens)} + \lambda_s \, 	ext{CE(size_class)} + \lambda_{sym} \, 	ext{CE(symmetry)}
   \]
   
2. **Neuro-Prior Loss**:
   \[
   L_{	ext{prior}} = \lambda_{	ext{ebr}} (\Phi + \kappa + 	ext{CGE} + 	ext{Hodge})
   \]
   - **Φ**: Phi synergy (integrated information).
   - **κ**: Kappa (assembly depth).
   - **CGE**: Compositional Generalization Energy.
   - **Hodge**: Penalty for non-conservative edge flows.

### **Training Metrics**:

- **Exact@1**: Percentage of tasks where the **first prediction** is the correct one.
- **Exact@K**: Percentage of tasks where the **correct solution** is within the top **K** predictions.
- **First-Hit Rate**: Probability that the **first candidate** is correct, with **no retries**.
- **Generalization Gap**: Difference in **Exact@1** on **seen tasks** vs. **unseen compositions** of known operations.
